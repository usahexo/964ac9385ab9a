#  Who played Ernie Scherer: The mystery of the gambling couple's death

Ernie and Sylvia Scherer were a gambling couple who met a mysterious and untimely death in 1950. Ernie was found shot to death in their car, while Sylvia's body was found nearby with strangulation marks around her neck. Officials suspected that the two had been killed during a robbery, as they were known to frequent casinos and had a large amount of cash on them at the time of their deaths. However, no suspects were ever identified and the case went cold.

Now, almost 70 years later, the identity of Ernie Scherer's killer may have finally been solved. In a recently released book, author Gary Jurofsky claims that he has uncovered evidence that suggests that the real killer was Ernie's brother-in-law, George Bednar. According to Jurofsky, Bednar was jealous of the Scherers' successful gambling career and killed them in order to take over their business.

This theory has been met with some skepticism, as there is no concrete evidence linking Bednar to the murders. However, Jurofsky's book has stirred up renewed interest in the case and officials are currently investigating Bednar as a possible suspect. Whatever the outcome of these new investigations, it is clear that the mystery of Ernie and Sylvia Scherer's death will continue to intrigue people for years to come.
