#  Which Poker Hands to Play in Money Games - Part 2

In the first installment of this two-part series, we took a look at which poker hands to play in money games when you have a strong starting hand. In this article, we will continue that discussion by examining which hands to play when you don't have a strong starting hand.

First and foremost, it's important to remember that playing any hand is better than folding. Even if your hand isn't the strongest possible, there's still a chance that you can make a good hand by drawing the right cards. With that said, here are a few hands to play in money games when you don't have a strong starting hand:

One pair - While one pair may not seem like much, it can still be a powerful hand in certain situations. For example, if you're up against two opponents and they both have low pairs (e.g., J-8 and Q-10), then your one pair will likely be the best hand on the table.

Two overcards - If you're dealt two overcards (e.g., A-K), then you should always be looking to make a straight or a flush. While it's not always easy to hit one of these hands, the potential payouts can be well worth it.

Suited connectors - Suited connectors (e.g., J-10) are another hand worth playing in money games. This is because there's a good chance that you'll be able to make a straight or flush with these cards. Plus, since they are suited, they also have some added value when going all-in preflop.

#  5 Poker Hands You Should be Playing in Cash Games

Texas hold’em is a game of incomplete information. This means that there are certain hands that you should be playing in cash games, and others that you should fold.

Here are 5 poker hands that you should be playing in cash games:

1. Pair

A pair is the most basic hand in Texas hold’em, and it should always be played if you have it. A pair offers good chances to make a set or two pair, and even if you don’t hit anything big, you can still usually win the pot by showdown.

2. Two-pair

Two-pair is another strong hand that should always be played. It has good potential to win against single pairs and also offers good odds to make a full house.

3. Three-of-a-kind

Three-of-a-kind is an incredibly powerful hand in Texas hold’em, and it should always be played if possible. This hand has a high chance of winning against any other combination of cards and can also make a four-of-a-kind or a straight flush.

4. Straight

A straight is another strong hand that should always be played. It has good potential to win against any other combination of cards except for a flush or a full house.

5. Flush

A flush is usually not as strong as some of the other hands on this list, but it still has decent potential to win the pot. If you have a flush, it’s usually best to bet aggressively so that you can win the pot immediately.

#  What are the 5 Best Poker Hands to Play in a Live Game?

When you’re playing poker in a live setting, there are some hands that are better to play than others. In this guide, we’ll take a look at the five best hands to play in a live poker game.

1. Aces

Aces are always a strong hand, and they’re especially good when played in early position. If you can get all the money in on the flop with an ace-high flush or straight, you’re likely to come out ahead.

2. Kings

Kings are another powerful hand that should be played aggressively in early position. If you can get all the money in with two kings on the flop, you have a great chance of winning the pot.

3. Queens

Queens are also a very strong hand, and they can be played aggressively in early position as well. With two queens on the flop, you have a big advantage over your opponents.

4. Jacks

Jacks are another great hand to play in a live game. They may not be as strong as aces or kings, but they’re still very powerful nonetheless. You should try to get all the money in with two jacks on the flop whenever possible.

5. Tens or Better

Tens or better is always a good hand to play in poker, and it’s especially strong when played in late position. If you can get all the money in with tens or better on the flop, you stand a good chance of winning the pot.
