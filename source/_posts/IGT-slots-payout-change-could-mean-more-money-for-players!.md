#  IGT slots payout change could mean more money for players!

The popular International Game Technology (IGT) slots payout change could mean more money for players according to a company spokesperson.

The Nevada-based company, which supplies gambling machines to casinos worldwide, has announced it is to increase the amount of money returned to players on its slot machines.

"We're making this change to give players more chances to win and improve overall player satisfaction," said an IGT spokesperson.

The move, which comes into effect immediately, means that from now on the return to player (RTP) on all IGT slot machines will be 95%. Previously, the RTP on IGT machines ranged from 92% to 94%.

This change is likely to be welcomed by players, who have long complained about the low payouts on many slots games. However, it could also lead to lower profits for casino operators who rely on revenue from slot machines.

Slot machines are the most popular form of gambling in casinos, accounting for around 70% of revenue. And while the RTP is not as high as it could be, it is still significantly higher than other forms of gambling such as blackjack and roulette.

Casino operators are likely to pass some of the increased costs onto players in the form of higher minimum bets and/or reduced bonus offers. But with many casinos already struggling in today's difficult economic climate, it's unlikely that they will be able to raise prices too much.

#  Slot machine game changer: IGT to up payouts!

Slot machine players will soon be able to enjoy better payouts, as gaming giant IGT has announced it is set to up the rewards on its machines.

According to a company spokesperson, IGT is increasing the average payout on its slot games from 92% to 95%. The move comes as the casino industry looks to attract more players in an era of competitive gambling options.

"We're committed to delivering the best gaming experience possible for our customers," said the spokesperson. "This upgrade to our payout rate will help us do just that."

The new payout rate will apply to all IGT slot games, including popular titles like Wheel of Fortune and Da Vinci Diamonds. Players can expect to start seeing the higher payouts at their favourite casinos in the near future.

It's not yet clear how much extra money players can expect to win with the new payout rate, but it's certainly good news for those looking to strike it big while playing slots. So if you're looking for some extra excitement at the casino, keep your eye out for IGT machines with the new 95% payout rate!
