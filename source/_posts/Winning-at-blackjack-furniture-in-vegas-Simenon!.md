 thanks to a little-known fact about the game.

The game of blackjack is all about making the best hand possible out of the two cards you are dealt. The Ace is especially powerful, as it can be counted as 1 or 11, giving players a lot of options when it comes to building their hands. 
When you’re playing blackjack in a casino, remember that the dealers must stand on all 17s. This gives players an advantage, as they can make moves knowing that the dealer cannot go bust.

There are a few basic tips that all blackjack players should keep in mind: 
-Never split 10s or 5s.
-If you have an Ace and a 10, always split them. You have a good chance of making two 21s this way.
-If the Dealer has an Ace showing, be very careful about hitting – he might have Blackjack and you will lose automatically!
-Remember that the Dealer must hit on 16 and below, so take advantage of this by having lower cards in your hand.

#  Playing blackjack furniture in vegas Simenon: how to maximize your chances of winning

When it comes to gambling, blackjack is one of the easiest games to play in a casino. However, like all casino games, there are strategies that you can use to improve your chances of winning. In this article, we're going to look at how to maximize your chances of winning when playing blackjack in Las Vegas.

The first thing you need to understand is the basic rules of blackjack. In blackjack, the aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by scoring more points than him. You can do this by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (called a "blackjack"), or by taking as many cards as you need until you reach 21 points. The dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17.

The second thing you need to understand is the value of different cards. In blackjack, the ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, and all other cards are worth their face value. This means that a 2 card combination like Ace-2 is worth 3 points (1+2), while an 8 card combination like King-Queen-Jack-10-9-8-7-6 is worth 23 points (8+10+9+8).

With that knowledge under your belt, let's take a look at some tips for increasing your chances of winning at blackjack in Las Vegas:

1) Stick to basic strategy - One of the best ways to improve your chances of winning at blackjack is to stick to basic strategy. This involves making decisions based on the cards you are dealt and the dealer's upcard. You can find basic strategy charts online which will tell you what decision to make in every possible situation. Following basic strategy gives you the best chance of winning without making any costly mistakes.

2) Know when to split - Another important thing to know about blackjack is when to split your cards. If you are dealt two cards of the same value, you can choose to split them into two separate hands. This increases your chances of winning exponentially, as long as you make good decisions thereafter regarding how to play each hand. It's important to remember that if you split Aces, you only receive one additional card for each hand.

3) Avoid Insurance - One trap that many players fall into is thinking that insurance is a good bet. In fact, insurance is often a bad bet for players because it has a high house edge . Unless you have a very strong hand, it's usually better not to take insurance and just hope for the best.

4) Don't go over 21 - One mistake that many players make is trying to get too many points by taking extra cards when they already have a good hand. This usually leads to them going over 21 and losing automatically. Aimto hit 21 or bust as early as possible in order tot maximize your chances of winning .
