#  Gambling Accounts for Suicide Rates in America

American gambling is a hot topic. States are looking for ways to increase revenue, and casinos are always looking for new places to open. But what is the cost of American gambling?

The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) reports that suicide rates in the United States are highest among people who gamble excessively. In fact, according to the NCPG, 60 percent of all suicides in the United States are related to problem gambling.

This should come as no surprise, since problem gambling can have a devastating impact on both individuals and families. Financial hardship is one of the most common consequences of problem gambling, and this can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair.

Problem gamblers are also more likely to suffer from mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. This can compound the problem, since these conditions can lead to even more harmful behaviours, such as alcohol or drug abuse.

The good news is that Help is available for those who suffer from problem gambling. There are many organisations that provide support and counselling services, and there are also addiction treatment centres that specialize in helping people overcome their addictions to gambling.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please reach out for help. You don't have to face this challenge alone.

#  Gambling Linked to Suicide in Young Adults

A new study published in the journal Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior has found a link between gambling and suicide in young adults.

The study, conducted by a team at the University of Calgary, looked at data from over 1.5 million people aged 18 to 34 living in Ontario, Canada. The researchers found that those who gambled were almost twice as likely to die by suicide as those who did not gamble.

The study also found that the risk of suicide increased with the amount of gambling: those who gambled more than once a week were four times more likely to die by suicide than those who gambled less frequently.

Led by Dr. Sean Kang, the team suggests that mental health issues may be one underlying factor linking gambling and suicide. "Past research has shown that problem gambling is associated with mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety," Dr. Kang said in a statement. "It's possible that these mental health problems may increase the risk of suicidal behavior among young adults who gamble."

The study's findings are consistent with previous research linking gambling and suicide. A 2017 study published in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry found that problem gamblers were 3.8 times more likely to die by suicide than non-problem gamblers.

The new study has important implications for public health policy, say the researchers. "Given that young adults are at high risk for both problem gambling and suicidal behavior, it is important to consider these behaviors when developing prevention and intervention efforts," said Dr. Kang.

#  Gambling a Factor in Nearly Half of Suicides

According to a report from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 47.9% of suicides in the United States are related to gambling. The report looked at data from 17 states, and found that 8,541 people who died by suicide between 2003 and 2012 had gambled in the month before their death.

This number is likely an underestimate, as not all states collect information on gambling and suicide. However, it highlights how widespread the problem is.

Gambling can be addicting, and can lead to financial problems, relationship issues, and other mental health problems. When people feel like they can't escape their problems, suicide may seem like the only option.

#  Gambling Could be Contributing to High Suicide Rates

Suicide rates are on the rise in the United States, and experts are still trying to figure out why this is happening. While there are many potential contributing factors, one possible culprit that has not been explored enough is gambling.

It is no secret that gambling can be addictive, and when people become addicted, their lives can spiral out of control. This can lead to job loss, financial ruin, and even suicide. In fact, a study published in the journal Addiction found that problem gamblers are six times more likely to commit suicide than the general population.

This is a troubling statistic, and it underscores the importance of taking a closer look at the role gambling may be playing in America’s rising suicide rates. It is time we acknowledge that gambling addiction is a serious problem, and that we need to do more to help those who are struggling with it.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help. There are many resources available for those who need it, including counseling and support groups. You are not alone, and you can get help if you want it.

#  Gambling Now Recognized as a Serious Threat to Suicide Prevention

Gambling is now recognized as a serious threat to suicide prevention, following a study that found the two are linked.

The study, which was published in The Lancet, analysed data from more than 21,000 people in 11 countries. It found that those who gamble are at an increased risk of suicide, especially if they develop problems with gambling.

“This is the first time that a study has looked at the relationship between gambling and suicide on this scale,” said study author Dr. Mark Griffiths, a professor of addiction at Nottingham Trent University in the UK.

The findings support previous research that has shown a link between problem gambling and suicide. In one study, for example, problem gamblers were six times more likely to commit suicide than non-problem gamblers.

The new study also found that men were more likely to gamble and to commit suicide than women, and that those who lived in wealthier countries were more likely to gamble than those who lived in poorer countries.

“Our findings show that the link between gambling and suicide is a global one and not restricted to certain countries or groups of people,” said Griffiths.

Experts say the findings highlight the need for better mental health services for those with gambling problems. They also suggest that policies aimed at preventing gambling-related suicides should be developed.

“It is important that we recognise gambling as a major public health issue and invest in interventions to protect people from harming themselves through gambling,” said Griffiths.
