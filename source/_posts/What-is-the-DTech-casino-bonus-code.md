#  What are the Wagering Requirements for the DTech casino bonus code?

One of the questions that often comes up when players are looking to sign up for a new online casino is what the Wagering Requirements are for the bonus code. This refers to the number of times the player has to play through the bonus amount before it becomes eligible for withdrawal.

For the DTech Casino, the Wagering Requirements for the bonus code is 35x. This means that players will have to wager 35 times the amount of their bonus before they can withdraw any winnings. It’s important to note that this only applies to the bonus amount and not to the deposited funds. Players can withdraw their deposited funds at any time, provided they meet any other withdrawal requirements that are in place.

It’s worth noting that not all games count equally towards meeting the Wagering Requirements. Slots will contribute 100% while most table games (roulette, blackjack, baccarat) will only contribute 10%. Other games such as video poker and scratch cards will usually contribute 50%. For more information on how individual games contribute, players can contact customer support.

Players should also be aware that different bets placed on slots or tables count differently towards meeting Wagering Requirements. For example, a bet of $10 on a slot machine will count as $10 worth of wagering, whereas a bet of $10 on blackjack will only count as $1 worth of wagering. This is why it’s important for players to carefully read through the terms and conditions of any casino bonus they’re considering using.
