The team is a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The team plays its home games at Ford Field in Downtown Detroit.\n\nAs of the end of the 2017 season, the Lions have had 51 seasons in the NFL. They have won four league championships and two Super Bowls. The Lions were founded in Portsmouth, Ohio as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1944. They joined the NFL in 1950 when the AAFC merged with the older league.\n\nThe club was owned by William Clay Ford, Sr. from 1963 until his death in 2014. His son, William Clay Ford Jr., has served as team president since 2003 and was owner from 2014 to 2018. The franchise has been run by general manager Bob Quinn since 2016.\n\nThe Detroit Lions have played their home games at Ford Field since 2002. The stadium seats 65,000 people and is expandable to up to 80,000 seats for other events.[1] Ford Field also hosts other events such as concerts and ice hockey games. The Lions previously played their home games at Tiger Stadium on Wayne State University's campus from 1938 to 2001 and at Pontiac Silverdome from 1975 to 2001.\n\n#  How do you 138Bet on the Detroit Lions?\n\nThe Detroit Lions are a professional American football team based in Detroit, Michigan. The Lions play in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) North division.\n\nThe team plays its home games at Ford Field in Downtown Detroit. The Lions were founded in 1929 and have played continuously in the NFL since then, making them one of four teams remaining in the league from its inaugural season.\n\nAs one of the oldest professional American football teams in the country, the Lions have won four NFL championships: 1935, 1938, 1943, and 1952. The last of those championships was won before the Super Bowl era.\n\nSince 1963, the Lions have been known as \"the Franchise\" or \"the Motor City Kitties\".\n\nThe Detroit Lions were established on July 8, 1929 when William Clay Ford, Sr. purchased the bankrupt Portsmouth Spartans for $270,000. Ford renamed the team the Lions after buying an outdoor advertising company that had a contract to paint lions on street cars in Detroit.\n\nPortsmouth had played one season as an independent team before joining the NFL. The Spartans had produced notable players such as Harold \"Red\" Grange and George Halas. However, their first year as an NFL team was a disaster on and off the field; they finished 1-10 and three players committed suicide. In 1930, Portsmouth sold half of their ownership interest to Detroit radio executive George Richards and moved to Detroit to become more competitive. Richards renamed them the Detroit Lions after his station WJR's call letters (which stood for \"World's Greatest Radio Station\"). In 1932 Richards became sole owner of the franchise.\n\nFor most of their early years, the Lions were coached by Potsy Clark. In 1941 they hired Fritz Pollard as head coach; he was America's first black coach in any major sport. Under Pollard, they posted an 8-3 record in 1944 and reached the Championship game against Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Ozzie Newsome but lost 14-6. After Pollard resigned following poor fan reaction to losing the title game,linebacker Joe Schmidt eventually became head coach and led them to three NFL championship games (1953,[4] 1954,[5] 1957), winning two.[6] In general manager Ernie Accorsi finally hired Wayne Fontes as head coach in 1988; Fontes led them to six playoff appearances during his eight-year tenure.[7][8] Marty Mornhinweg succeeded Fontes in 2001 but was fired after three seasons with a 5-27 record (.156).[9] Steve Mariucci was hired coaching job during 2003 season and led team to two playoff appearances including an NFC championship game loss during 2006 season.[10] During 2007 Martha Firestone Ford brought her son Bill Ford Jr., who had beenChairman of Ferrari North America and Vice Chairman of Ford Motor Company along with new GM Martin Mayhew to unsuccessfully try to revive team fortunes.[11][7][12][13] On November 22nd ,2015 after 21 years Matt Millen was fired from all football operations due to his terrible track record eights years ago .     In 2016 Jim Caldwell was fired after going 9-7 .Detroit is now looking for a new head coach .

The club was formed in 1970 by the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain. PSG is the most successful French club in terms of trophies, with 36 league titles, 30 Coupe de France wins and six Coupes de la Ligue titles. The club has also reached the final of the UEFA Champions League twice, in 1995 and 2006.\n\nThe French giant is one of the most popular football clubs on the planet, with a strong following all over Europe and South America. PSG’s fanbase is famously loyal and passionate, creating an electrifying atmosphere at the Parc des Princes on matchdays.\n\nThe team had a somewhat disappointing 2018-19 season by their high standards, finishing second behind Ligue 1 winners Olympique Lyonnais. However, they will be looking to bounce back next year and regain their crown as France’s top team. Neymar Jr., Kylian Mbappé and Edinson Cavani are some of the best players in world football, so they will be a force to be reckoned with in 2019-20.\n\nIf you’re interested in betting on PSG’s fortunes next season, then you’ll be pleased to know that there are plenty of 2022 odds available online. You can find out more about these odds by reading our comprehensive guide below.\n\n# How to bet on Paris Saint-Germain F.C.?\n\nThere are various different ways that you can bet on Paris Saint-Germain F.C.. Below are some of the most popular bets that you can place:\n\nOutright Winner: This is a bet on which team will win the league or cup competition outright. PSG are one of the favourites to win the Ligue 1 title next season, so this could be a lucrative bet if you fancy them to come out on top.\n\nTo Qualify: This is a bet on whether or not a team will qualify for a particular tournament or competition. PSG are favourites to qualify for next season’s UEFA Champions League, so this could be a sensible bet to place if you think they’ll reach the knockout stages.\n\nMatch Result: This is a bet on which team will win or lose a particular match. If you think that PSG will beat Lyon in their upcoming clash, then you would back them to win at odds of 1/2 or better.\n\n#  How many points do you need to win a Paris Saint-Germain F.C. 2022 wager?\n\nA Paris Saint-Germain F.C. 2022 wager is a bet on who will win the French football club’s next championship. The odds are typically offered by sportsbooks in either fractional (2/1), decimal (3.00) or American (-200) formats. \n\nUsually, you need to gamble at least 100 points to receive a payout that is equal to your original stake. So, for example, if you wagered 200 points on PSG and they went on to win the title, you would earn a return of 400 points (200 x 2). Conversely, if you lost your bet, you would lose your initial 200 points stake. \n\nLike many other types of sporting bets, there is always risk involved when gambling on who will win a particular competition. However, by doing your research and studying the form guide, you can give yourself a much better chance of making money betting on Paris Saint-Germain F.C.’s 2022 success!\n\n#  Are there any other types of bets available for Paris Saint-Germain F.C. 2022?\n\nParis Saint-Germain F.C. is a professional football club based in the Parisian suburb of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France. The club was formed in 1970 by the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain. PSG are the most successful French club in history, having won 32 domestic trophies, including Ligue 1 titles in 1984, 1994, 2004, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe club also has a strong rivalry with Olympique de Marseille; matches between the two sides are known as the Derby de France. PSG's home ground is Parc des Princes in Paris. The head coach is Thomas Tuchel and the captain is Thiago Silva.\n\nIt is safe to say that Paris Saint-Germain F.C. will be one of the teams to watch out for during the 2022 FIFA World Cup. But what are your betting options when it comes to this team? Are there any other types of bets available?\n\n punters can bet on whether or not paris saint germain will win the ligue 1 title during the upcoming season at any given time during the season\nprogrammed bets such as these can be found at many online sportsbooks\nFor example, at Betway Sportsbook you can currently bet on whether or not Paris Saint-Germain will win their eighth consecutive Ligue 1 title this season. They are set as heavy favourites at 1/10 odds, but if you think they might falter then there’s always the possibility of a big payout from betting on them not to win.","source":"_posts/How-often-can-you-bet-on-the-Detroit-Lions.md","raw":"---\ntitle: How often can you bet on the Detroit Lions\ndate: 2022-09-23 01:09:41\ncategories:\n- 138bet\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  How often can you bet on the Detroit Lions?\n\nThe Detroit Lions are a professional American football team based in Detroit, Michigan.

They have won four league championships and two Super Bowls. The Lions were founded in Portsmouth, Ohio as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1944. They joined the NFL in 1950 when the AAFC merged with the older league.</p>\n<p>The club was owned by William Clay Ford, Sr. from 1963 until his death in 2014. His son, William Clay Ford Jr., has served as team president since 2003 and was owner from 2014 to 2018.

The Lions play in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league’s National Football Conference (NFC) North division.</p>\n<p>The team plays its home games at Ford Field in Downtown Detroit. The Lions were founded in 1929 and have played continuously in the NFL since then, making them one of four teams remaining in the league from its inaugural season.</p>\n<p>As one of the oldest professional American football teams in the country, the Lions have won four NFL championships: 1935, 1938, 1943, and 1952. The last of those championships was won before the Super Bowl era.</p>\n<p>Since 1963, the Lions have been known as “the Franchise” or “the Motor City Kitties”.</p>\n<p>The Detroit Lions were established on July 8, 1929 when William Clay Ford, Sr. purchased the bankrupt Portsmouth Spartans for $270,000. Ford renamed the team the Lions after buying an outdoor advertising company that had a contract to paint lions on street cars in Detroit.</p>\n<p>Portsmouth had played one season as an independent team before joining the NFL. The Spartans had produced notable players such as Harold “Red” Grange and George Halas. However, their first year as an NFL team was a disaster on and off the field; they finished 1-10 and three players committed suicide. In 1930, Portsmouth sold half of their ownership interest to Detroit radio executive George Richards and moved to Detroit to become more competitive. Richards renamed them the Detroit Lions after his station WJR’s call letters (which stood for “World’s Greatest Radio Station”). In 1932 Richards became sole owner of the franchise.</p>\n<p>For most of their early years, the Lions were coached by Potsy Clark. In 1941 they hired Fritz Pollard as head coach; he was America’s first black coach in any major sport. Under Pollard, they posted an 8-3 record in 1944 and reached the Championship game against Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Ozzie Newsome but lost 14-6. After Pollard resigned following poor fan reaction to losing the title game,linebacker Joe Schmidt eventually became head coach and led them to three NFL championship games (1953,[4] 1954,[5] 1957), winning two.[6] In general manager Ernie Accorsi finally hired Wayne Fontes as head coach in 1988; Fontes led them to six playoff appearances during his eight-year tenure.[7][8] Marty Mornhinweg succeeded Fontes in 2001 but was fired after three seasons with a 5-27 record (.156).[9] Steve Mariucci was hired coaching job during 2003 season and led team to two playoff appearances including an NFC championship game loss during 2006 season.[10] During 2007 Martha Firestone Ford brought her son Bill Ford Jr., who had beenChairman of Ferrari North America and Vice Chairman of Ford Motor Company along with new GM Martin Mayhew to unsuccessfully try to revive team fortunes.[11][7][12][13] On November 22nd ,2015 after 21 years Matt Millen was fired from all football operations due to his terrible track record eights years ago .
