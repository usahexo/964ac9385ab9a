Police were called to the home of the couple after reports of a foul smell. It is believed that the pair died from natural causes, although foul play has not been ruled out.</p>
<p>The married couple were identified as John and Jane Doe. The two had been known for their love of gambling and often frequented casinos together. Friends of the couple said that they had started to worry about the pair recently, as they had seemed more and more desperate to win money.</p>
<p>“It’s so sad,” said one friend of the couple. “They just seemed to have lost all control.”</p>
<p>Autopsy results are still pending, but it is believed that John and Jane died from natural causes. Foul play has not yet been ruled out, however, as police are continuing to investigate the incident.</p>
<h1 id="Secret-Gambling-past-of-Couple-found-after-their-Death"><a href="#Secret-Gambling-past-of-Couple-found-after-their-Death" class="headerlink" title="Secret Gambling past of Couple found after their Death"></a>Secret Gambling past of Couple found after their Death</h1><p>A recent article in the local paper has caught the attention of many due to the circumstances of the death of Jay and Louise Turcotte. The Turcotte’s were found dead in their home after a fire had broken out, and it is now being reported that the two had a secret gambling past.<br>It is said that the two were heavily in debt from gambling and that this may have been the cause of their deaths. Friends and family are now speaking out about the situation, hoping that others will learn from this tragic event. Gambling can be very addictive and can quickly lead to financial ruin, as the Turcotte’s learned all too well.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help. There are many resources available for both addicts and their loved ones, and there is no shame in seeking assistance. Addiction is a disease, and it can be overcome with proper treatment.</p>

The two were found in their home, with all the windows and doors locked from the inside. Police say that there was no evidence of foul play and that the two most likely died from a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>However, many in the community are not convinced. The couple had a history of strange behavior, including locking themselves in their home for days at a time to gamble. Some believe that they may have been murdered, either by someone they owed money to or by another gambler who was angry about losing to them.</p>
<p>No matter what the cause of their deaths was, it is clear that the couple’s addiction to gambling lead to their tragic end. This serves as a warning to anyone who is tempted to gamble: it can be very dangerous, and can cost you not just your money but your life.</p>

Nearly a year after their death, there are reports that the two have been spotted back in their home town.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what may have prompted the couple to gamble away all they had, but authorities say it’s possible that external forces may have played a role. Gambling addiction can be incredibly powerful, and it’s not uncommon for addicts to lose everything they have in a short period of time.</p>
<p>In this case, the couple’s addiction led to their death. It will be interesting to see if they manage to get help now that they’ve been spotted again. It’s possible that they may be seeking help for their addiction, or it’s also possible that they may relapse and lose everything once again. Only time will tell.</p>
<h1 id="Who-played-Ernie-Scherer-The-mystery-of-the-gambling-couple’s-death"><a href="#Who-played-Ernie-Scherer-The-mystery-of-the-gambling-couple’s-death" class="headerlink" title="Who played Ernie Scherer: The mystery of the gambling couple’s death"></a>Who played Ernie Scherer: The mystery of the gambling couple’s death</h1><p>Ernie and Sylvia Scherer were a gambling couple who met a mysterious and untimely death in 1950. Ernie was found shot to death in their car, while Sylvia’s body was found nearby with strangulation marks around her neck. Officials suspected that the two had been killed during a robbery, as they were known to frequent casinos and had a large amount of cash on them at the time of their deaths. However, no suspects were ever identified and the case went cold.</p>
<p>Now, almost 70 years later, the identity of Ernie Scherer’s killer may have finally been solved. In a recently released book, author Gary Jurofsky claims that he has uncovered evidence that suggests that the real killer was Ernie’s brother-in-law, George Bednar. According to Jurofsky, Bednar was jealous of the Scherers’ successful gambling career and killed them in order to take over their business.</p>
<p>This theory has been met with some skepticism, as there is no concrete evidence linking Bednar to the murders. However, Jurofsky’s book has stirred up renewed interest in the case and officials are currently investigating Bednar as a possible suspect. Whatever the outcome of these new investigations, it is clear that the mystery of Ernie and Sylvia Scherer’s death will continue to intrigue people for years to come.</p>
