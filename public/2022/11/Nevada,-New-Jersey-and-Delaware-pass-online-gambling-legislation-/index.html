        <h1 id="Nevada-New-Jersey-and-Delaware-pass-online-gambling-legislation"><a href="#Nevada-New-Jersey-and-Delaware-pass-online-gambling-legislation" class="headerlink" title="Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware pass online gambling legislation"></a>Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware pass online gambling legislation</h1><p>In the past few weeks, three more US states - Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware - have legalized some form of online gambling. This brings the total number of US states with legal online gambling to six, plus Washington DC.</p>
<p>Nevada was the first state to legalize online poker in 2011, and New Jersey followed suit in 2013. Delaware passed legislation to legalize all types of online gambling in 2012, but it wasn’t until June this year that any sites went live.</p>
<p>The three new states have all taken different approaches to regulating online gambling. Nevada has licensed a limited number of operators, while New Jersey has allowed a large number of operators but with strict controls on what they can offer. Delaware has adopted a more laissez faire approach, with just one operator currently offering games.</p>
<p>The passing of these bills is seen as a good sign for the future of online gambling in the US. The Department of Justice issued a opinion in December last year which clarified that the 1961 Wire Act only applies to sports betting, opening the way for other forms of gambling to be regulated at the state level.</p>
<h1 id="States-join-forces-to-create-a-larger-online-gambling-market"><a href="#States-join-forces-to-create-a-larger-online-gambling-market" class="headerlink" title="States join forces to create a larger online gambling market"></a>States join forces to create a larger online gambling market</h1><p>A number of US states are looking to create a larger online gambling market by working together. The move is in response to the recent repeal of the federal ban on sports betting.</p>
<p>New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey are among the states that have announced plans to work together to create a larger online gambling market. This would allow them to offer a wider range of gambling options, including online poker, casino games, and sports betting.</p>
<p>The repeal of the federal ban on sports betting has given states the opportunity to legalize and regulate the activity within their borders. However, many states are choosing to work together in order to create a larger market that can offer more gambling options.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that states have worked together to create an online gambling market. In 2013, Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey formed a partnership known as “The Tri-State Agreement”. This allowed residents of those states to gamble at each other’s casinos online.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether all of the states involved in this latest initiative will be able to come to an agreement on how best to proceed. However, there is certainly potential for a large-scale online gambling market to emerge in the United States.</p>
<h1 id="California-misses-out-on-new-online-gambling-alliance"><a href="#California-misses-out-on-new-online-gambling-alliance" class="headerlink" title="California misses out on new online gambling alliance"></a>California misses out on new online gambling alliance</h1><p>A new online gambling alliance has been formed, but California has been left out in the cold.</p>
<p>The coalition was announced by MGM Resorts International and includes nine other major casino companies, including Caesars Entertainment Corporation and Las Vegas Sands Corporation. The move comes as a response to the growing popularity of Internet gambling, which is seen as a threat to the traditional casino industry.</p>
<p>The alliance will focus on developing shared technologies and platforms that can be used to power online casinos. It is also hoped that the partnership will help to create a more regulated and safe online gambling environment.</p>
<p>So far, California has not joined the alliance. This is likely due to the fact that the state already has a well-developed online gambling market, which is estimated to be worth $3 billion annually. Joining the alliance would likely mean ceding some control over this market to the other members of the coalition.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether California will eventually join the alliance, or if it will try to form its own partnership with other states.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-could-be-the-next-state-to-join-the-online-gambling-alliance"><a href="#Illinois-could-be-the-next-state-to-join-the-online-gambling-alliance" class="headerlink" title="Illinois could be the next state to join the online gambling alliance"></a>Illinois could be the next state to join the online gambling alliance</h1><p>Illinois lawmakers are considering a new bill that would allow the state to join the online gambling alliance. The proposed bill, which was introduced by Representative Lou Lang (D-Skokie), would authorize Illinois to join Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware in the interstate pact that allows players from those states to gamble online.</p>
<p>The proposed bill has been welcomed by the gambling industry, with some analysts predicting that it could generate as much as $200 million in new revenue for the state each year. That’s a significant amount of money, and it’s no surprise that the proposal is attracting a lot of attention.</p>
<p>There are, however, some potential roadblocks that could prevent the bill from becoming law. First of all, there is some opposition to online gambling from within the state government. Secondly, there are concerns that the proposed legislation might violate federal law. Finally, there is also the question of whether or not Illinois residents will actually want to gamble online.</p>
<p>Despite these potential roadblocks, the proposed bill is still attracting a great deal of attention, and it will be interesting to see what happens next.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-may-soon-follow-in-the-footsteps-of-Nevada-and-Delaware"><a href="#Pennsylvania-may-soon-follow-in-the-footsteps-of-Nevada-and-Delaware" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania may soon follow in the footsteps of Nevada and Delaware"></a>Pennsylvania may soon follow in the footsteps of Nevada and Delaware</h1><p>Pennsylvania may soon be the third US state to legalize online poker and other casino games.</p>
<p>This move could provide a major boost to the state’s economy, as well as help to create thousands of new jobs.</p>
<p>The bill, which was proposed by state senator Jay Costa, is currently being considered by the legislature.</p>
<p>If it is passed, it will allow people over the age of 21 to play poker and other casino games online.</p>
<p>It will also allow casinos in the state to offer these games to their customers.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill believe that it will help to create thousands of new jobs in the state, as well as generate millions of dollars in tax revenue.</p>
<p>They also believe that it will help to keep Pennsylvania’s gambling industry competitive with other states.</p>
