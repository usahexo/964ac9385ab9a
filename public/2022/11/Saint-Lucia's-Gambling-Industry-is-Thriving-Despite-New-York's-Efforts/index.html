People come from all over to enjoy its pristine beaches, lush vegetation, and duty-free shopping. But what many people don’t know is that Saint Lucia is also a major gambling destination. The government has been working hard to make the industry thrive, and it seems to be paying off.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, New York lawmakers passed a bill that would make it illegal for companies based in that state to offer online gambling services to residents of Saint Lucia. This was seen as a major blow to the industry, as New York is home to some of the biggest gaming companies in the world. However, Saint Lucia’s gambling industry has proved resilient, and continues to thrive despite New York’s efforts.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this resilience. First, Saint Lucia has a well-developed infrastructure for online gambling. The government has invested heavily in this infrastructure, and there are now dozens of licensed gaming operators in the country. Second, Saint Lucia offers a wide variety of online gambling options, including casino games, sports betting, and poker. And third, Saint Lucia’s licensing regime is among the most liberal in the world. This allows gaming companies to operate with minimal restrictions, which helps attract business investment and create jobs.</p>
<p>The results have been impressive. The value of Saint Lucia’s online gambling industry has grown by leaps and bounds over the past few years. In 2017, it was estimated that the industry was worth $100 million USD. By 2020, it is expected to grow to $300 million USD. This growth is creating jobs and generating tax revenue for the government. It is also attracting new tourists to the island, who come not only for the sun and sand but also for a chance to try their luck at the casino or bet on their favorite team.</p>
<p>New York’s efforts may have failed so far, but they are not likely to stop Saint Lucia’s gambling industry from thriving. The government has made it clear that it intends to keep investing in this sector, and will continue to welcome foreign investors who want to participate in it. So if you’re looking for a place where you can gamble legally online, look no further than Saint Lucia!</p>
<h1 id="Saint-Lucia-Defies-New-York-in-Battle-over-Gambling"><a href="#Saint-Lucia-Defies-New-York-in-Battle-over-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Saint Lucia Defies New York in Battle over Gambling"></a>Saint Lucia Defies New York in Battle over Gambling</h1><p>Saint Lucia is defying New York in a legal battle over gambling.</p>
<p>In June, the state of New York filed a lawsuit against Saint Lucia, accusing the Caribbean island nation of illegally allowing Internet gaming companies to operate from its territory.</p>
<p>New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement that the island’s actions have had a “severe and continuing impact” on the state’s gambling market, costing it millions of dollars in lost revenue.</p>
<p>But Saint Lucia has denied the allegations, with its Prime Minister Kenny Anthony calling them “baseless” and “ill-conceived.”</p>
<p>The legal battle is now playing out in federal court, where Saint Lucia is seeking to have the case dismissed. A decision is expected later this year.</p>
<p>The dispute between the two countries highlights the growing global clash over online gambling. While some countries are looking to cash in on the industry, others are trying to crack down on it, arguing that it can lead to addiction and other social ills.</p>
<p>Saint Lucia has emerged as a key player in the online gambling world in recent years. The tiny country – population about 190,000 – boasts an Internet infrastructure that is among the most robust in the region, making it an attractive base for online gaming companies.</p>
<p>At least 15 such companies are believed to be currently operating from Saint Lucia, including PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Bovada Casino. Many of these firms were targeted last year by U.S. authorities in a crackdown on offshore gambling sites aimed at protecting stateside gamblers.</p>
<p>The New York lawsuit alleges that Saint Lucia has failed to shut down these companies or enforce its own laws against online gambling, costing New York tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue each year. It also accuses Saint Lucia of helping the companies circumvent American laws and regulations.</p>
<h1 id="Saint-Lucia-Rejects-New-York’s-Efforts-to-Combat-Vice-Gambling"><a href="#Saint-Lucia-Rejects-New-York’s-Efforts-to-Combat-Vice-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Saint Lucia Rejects New York’s Efforts to Combat Vice Gambling"></a>Saint Lucia Rejects New York’s Efforts to Combat Vice Gambling</h1><p>Saint Lucia has become the second Caribbean country after Antigua to publicly reject a proposal by the New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) to help combat illegal gambling in the region.</p>
<p>In a letter dated July 9, the chair of Saint Lucia’s Gaming Authority (SLGA), Calvin Clarke, said that his agency had “no intention of entering into any arrangement” with the NYSGC.</p>
<p>Clarke said that Saint Lucia has a “robust and effective regulatory regime” and does not need help from NYSGC. He also accused the U.S. commission of having a “colonial mindset” and said its proposal was “derogatory and insulting.”</p>
<p>The NYSGC proposal, which was first made public in June, would have seen the two commissions collaborate on intelligence-sharing, joint investigations, and training for law enforcement officials in the region.</p>
<p>Antigua rejected the proposal earlier this month, saying that it would give too much power to the NYSGC.</p>
<p>The issue of illegal gambling has been a contentious one in the Caribbean region for many years. The U.S. is largely seen as responsible for the proliferation of illegal gambling operations in the region, as it has cracked down on such operations on its own soil.</p>
<h1 id="Saint-Lucia-Dismisses-New-York’s-Crusade-against-Gambling"><a href="#Saint-Lucia-Dismisses-New-York’s-Crusade-against-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Saint Lucia Dismisses New York’s Crusade against Gambling"></a>Saint Lucia Dismisses New York’s Crusade against Gambling</h1><p>Saint Lucia has dismissed New York’s crusade against online gambling as a hypocritical attempt to protect the state’s land-based casino industry. The eastern Caribbean country, which is gearing up to launch its own online gambling industry, said the New York campaign is “based on false information and unsupported allegations.”</p>
<p>Saint Lucia Communications Minister Guy Mayers said his country is committed to the responsible regulation of online gambling, while New York is using “protectionism” to shield its struggling casinos.</p>
<p>“It is noteworthy that the state of New York has not undertaken any such campaign against other types of remote gaming, such as lotteries or horse racing,” Mayers said in a statement.</p>
<p>New York last month launched a campaign seeking to stamp out illegal online gambling, which it says costs the state millions of dollars in lost revenue each year. The state has also asked Congress to pass legislation outlawing most forms of online gambling.</p>
<p>But Saint Lucia says its proposed online gambling industry will be tightly regulated and will include measures to ensure minors are not allowed to gamble and that players are protected from fraud and other abuse.</p>
<p>The island nation is one of several Caribbean countries looking to cash in on the growing global market for online gambling. Antigua and Barbuda, another Caribbean country, launched its own online gambling industry in 1994 and has been embroiled in a long-running dispute with the United States over the issue.</p>
<h1 id="Saint-Lucia-Stands-Strong-against-New-York’s-Anti-Gambling-Campaign"><a href="#Saint-Lucia-Stands-Strong-against-New-York’s-Anti-Gambling-Campaign" class="headerlink" title="Saint Lucia Stands Strong against New York’s Anti-Gambling Campaign"></a>Saint Lucia Stands Strong against New York’s Anti-Gambling Campaign</h1><p>The Caribbean island of Saint Lucia is standing up to New York’s efforts to shut down its online gaming industry.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the New York attorney general brought a lawsuit against the major gambling companies operating in Saint Lucia, accusing them of illegal gambling activity that targets New Yorkers.</p>
<p>Saint Lucia has responded by filing a counterclaim against New York, arguing that its online gaming industry is legitimate and legal. The island nation also points out that its gaming industry employs thousands of people and generates millions of dollars in revenue each year.</p>
<p>Saint Lucia’s attorney general, Leonne Theodore-John, says that the island nation will fight “tooth and nail” to protect its online gaming industry.</p>
<p>New York’s anti-gambling campaign is motivated by a desire to protect the state’s casinos and racetracks from competition. But Saint Lucia argues that its online gaming industry is different from gambling activity that takes place in New York, and that it should be allowed to operate independently.</p>
<p>The legal battle between Saint Lucia and New York is likely to continue for some time, but the Caribbean island is determined to protect its online gaming industry.</p>
